# Hotel Reservation
This project involves deriving insights from an hotel dataset over 3 years through visualization. 
The dataset include important features such as Average daily rate, Cost, Days spent, Cancelled reservations, Booking type, Customer type, Repeated guest and car parking spaces.
The target feature is 'is_canceled' which describes if a reservation was canceled or not.

## QUICK INSIGHTS FROM THE VISUALIZATIONS
1. There is a strong correlation between the number of adults and discount.
This might mean that adults receive more discounts during reservation.
2. Customer Type and Parking Space
The Transient account type have majority of the parking spaces which means customers with that account make more reservations.
3. Revenue by Country
European countries generated the most revenue among other continents with Portugal being the highest.
4. Lodgings & Parking Spaces by Country
Portugal had the maximum amount of lodgings among all countries and also more car spaces than the other countries.
